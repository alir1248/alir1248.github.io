## Committing and Deploying to Github Pages

In order to build and deploy the project, run: 

    npm run build
    npm run deploy

If you want to add a commit message, append `-- -m "Message here"` to the deploy command.

## Committing the source code

    git add .
    git commit -m "Message here"
    git push origin main
